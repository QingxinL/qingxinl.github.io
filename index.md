I am a freshman at University of Washington, intended to double major in mathematics and statistics. 

I am interested in data science in general, including things like machine learning and quantitative finance. And I also love to take online course. Online courses I've taken include: [MIT 6.00.1](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11) [Harvard CS109](http://cs109.github.io/2015/).

# Here are some projects I have worked / currently working on:


## Soul App Analysis 
This is a project I work with a research group at Xiamen University in China. We want to analyze a popular social networking app called 'Soul'.
- Collected data from the app using a proxy server called [AnyProxy](http://anyproxy.io/en/) and compared top posts and non top posts' content length, number of likes and number of comments with Tableau. 
- Did text processing in Python with [Jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) api.
- Currently build a topic model on top posts, using LDA and TFIDF. There are some particular features of the app makes modeling difficult. The app is anonymous, and most of the posts are related to personal feelings, so it does not make sense to model on big topics like business, sports, etc, which is what people typically do on twitter topic models. 

## Day effect on Return
This is a project I work with Professor Leung in Department of Applied Math. We want to analyze the difference of stock return on different day of the week.
- Replicate results from past papers, regenerated figures and tables.
- Visualize data and computes stats in Python.
- Learned basic time series models when replicating results from [The day of the week effect on stock market volatility](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02744521), implemented OLS and GARCH model on S&P 500 historical data.

## Job Info Crawler 
This is a project for my personal use (job search).
[You can see this project on my Github] (https://github.com/QingxinL/Job_Info)

## Titanic Machine Learning (Kaggle)
I also did the Kaggle Competiton on Titanic Machine learning. I am still trying to learn more machine learning and will keep trying Kaggle as I get more experienced.
